# Internet-Controlled-Bot-with-a-Raspberry-Pi-using-Flask-Framework
We are going to use a Python web framework called Flask to turn the Raspberry Pi into a dynamic web server. And from this server we will be able to control our bot and it can move any where we want.

Connect the Raspberry pi as given in the Schematic Diagram:
Install Flask Web Framework and follow the commands given below:
Installation of Pip
# $  sudo apt-get install python-pip

Installation of Flask
# $  sudo pip install flask

Make a python Bot_control.py file and copy & paste code directly. 
# $ nano Bot_control.py

Then, make a Directory of name templates.
# $ mkdir templates
# $ nano main.html

# $ cd ..
Run code 
# $ python Bot_control.py

Open your browser with a IP address of your Raspberry pi (192.168.0.5 in my case).
